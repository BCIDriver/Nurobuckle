# NuroBuckle: Make Roads Safe Again

**NuroBuckle** is a neuro-aware safety platform designed to combat one of the deadliest and costliest problems in the trucking industry: driver fatigue. Leveraging real-time EEG monitoring and intelligent intervention through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), NuroBuckle helps keep drivers safe, alert, and on the road—sustainably.

## 🚨 Problem

Driver fatigue is a critical safety risk:

- **13%** of large truck crashes involve fatigue — *Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)*
- **30–40%** of heavy truck accidents are caused by fatigue — *National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)*
- Fatigue-related crashes cause **71,000 injuries** and **800 deaths** annually — *National Safety Council (NSC)*
- Cost to the U.S. economy: **$109 billion/year** (not including property damage) — *NSC*
- Existing tools like **camera monitoring** and **time tracking** are reactive, imprecise, and often ignored — *North American Fatigue Management Program (NAFMP)*

## ✅ Solution

**NuroBuckle** introduces a proactive and personalized system for fatigue prevention:

- 🧠 **Real-Time EEG Monitoring**: Lightweight, wearable EEG devices continuously analyze brainwave activity to detect drowsiness, microsleeps, or attention drops.
- 🗺️ **AI-Powered Smart Routing**: If fatigue is detected, the system dynamically reroutes drivers to rest stops, truck stations, or scenic pullovers.
- 📡 **Fleet Alerts via MCP**: Sends real-time SMS/email alerts to fleet managers using Twilio + MCP integration, enabling proactive intervention.
- 🎶 **Driver Re-Engagement**: Triggers music, audio cues, or a conversational agent to re-engage drivers based on personalized fatigue profiles.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **EEG Integration**  
   Real-time data from Emotiv Insight or Epoc+ headsets is streamed via Cortex API.

2. **Fatigue Detection Engine**  
   AI models analyze metrics like stress, attention, and engagement to detect early fatigue signals.

3. **MCP-Orchestrated Response**  
   When thresholds are crossed:
   - A rest stop is recommended on the route
   - Alerts are dispatched to fleet management
   - In-cab interventions are activated

4. **Seamless Dispatch Communication**  
   Integration with MCP and Twilio ensures fatigue events are logged, tracked, and actionable across platforms.
